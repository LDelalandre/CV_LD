	abstract = {Beyond the local abundance of species, their functional trait distinctiveness is now recognized as a key driver of community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. Yet, since the functional distinctiveness of a species is always relative to a given species pool, a species distinct at regional scale might not necessarily be distinct at local or community scale, and reciprocally. To assess the importance of scale (i.e. the definition of a species pool) when quantifying the functional distinctiveness of species, and how it might distort the ecological conclusions derived from it, we quantified trait distinctiveness of 1350 plant species at regional, local and community scales over ca 88 000 grassland plots in France. We measured differences in functional distinctiveness of species between regional (mainland France), local (10 × 10 km cell) and community (10 × 10 m plot) scale, and tested the influence of environmental predictors (climate and nitrogen input) and contexts (environmental distinctiveness, frequency and heterogeneity) on these variations. In line with theoretical expectations, we found large variation in functional distinctiveness (in particular between regional and community scales) for many species, with a general tendency of lower distinctiveness at smaller scales. We also showed that nitrogen input – a key aspect of high land use intensity – and environmental frequency partly explained the differences between local and regional scale only. These results suggest the role played by environmental filtering on species distinctiveness at local scale, but the determinant of distinctiveness variations at community scale still need to be elucidated. Our study provides robust empirical evidence that measures of ecological originality are strongly scale-dependent. We urge ecologists to carefully consider the scale at which they measure distinctiveness, as ignoring scale dependencies could lead to biased (or even entirely wrong) conclusions when not considered at the scale of interest for the respective research question.},

	abstract = {Biotic interactions are important drivers shaping communities and their net effect can be difficult to assess when many species are involved or the study system is not well-known. Co-occurrence data are increasingly used to infer biotic interactions, but their accuracy remains poorly studied. We hypothesize that the predictions of biotic interactions based on co-occurrence networks are scale-dependent, being more accurate when co-occurrence is sampled at the spatial scale at which biotic interactions occur. We studied a plant community in a semi-arid gypsum environment, where plant-plant interactions result in a clumped distribution of the vegetation, which allows a straightforward identification of the scale at which interactions occur (i.e. vegetation patches). We used Bayesian network inferences to detect co-occurrence patterns at two spatial scales (patches of about 0.05 m2 and plots of 2.25 m2), and measured plant-plant interactions based on the effects of plant species on the establishment and recruitment of their neigbours. The co-occurrence network inferred at the patch scale did not reflect the plant-plant interactions observed, and the networks inferred at two different spatial scales showed contrasted topologies. Negative spatial associations between species predominated in the network inferred at the patch scale, partially due to a low species richness in vegetation patches. Meanwhile, positive relationships predominated at the plot scale. Relationships at the plot scale could reflect the final outcome of multi-specific biotic interactions, but without providing accurate information about pairwise interactions. Our results suggest that co-occurrence networks can be useful to generate hypothesis about the mechanisms structuring communities, but caution is needed in the interpretation of co-occurrence patterns in terms of biotic interactions, even when they are measured at apparently appropriate spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Plant recruitment interactions (i.e., what recruits under what) shape the composition, diversity, and structure of plant communities. Despite the huge body of knowledge on the mechanisms underlying recruitment interactions among species, we still know little about the structure of the recruitment networks emerging in ecological communities. Modeling and analyzing the community-level structure of plant recruitment interactions as a complex network can provide relevant information on ecological and evolutionary processes acting both at the species and ecosystem levels. We report a data set containing 143 plant recruitment networks in 23 countries across five continents, including temperate and tropical ecosystems. Each network identifies the species under which another species recruits. All networks report the number of recruits (i.e., individuals) per species. The data set includes {\textgreater}850,000 recruiting individuals involved in 118,411 paired interactions among 3318 vascular plant species across the globe. The cover of canopy species and open ground is also provided. Three sampling protocols were used: (1) The Recruitment Network (RN) protocol (106 networks) focuses on interactions among established plants (“canopy species”) and plants in their early stages of recruitment (“recruit species”). A series of plots was delimited within a locality, and all the individuals recruiting and their canopy species were identified; (2) The paired Canopy-Open (pCO) protocol (26 networks) consists in locating a potential canopy plant and identifying recruiting individuals under the canopy and in a nearby open space of the same area; (3) The Georeferenced plot (GP) protocol (11 networks) consists in using information from georeferenced individual plants in large plots to infer canopy-recruit interactions. Some networks incorporate data for both herbs and woody species, whereas others focus exclusively on woody species. The location of each study site, geographical coordinates, country, locality, responsible author, sampling dates, sampling method, and life habits of both canopy and recruit species are provided. This database will allow researchers to test ecological, biogeographical, and evolutionary hypotheses related to plant recruitment interactions.

	abstract = {Despite evidence of a positive effect of functional diversity on ecosystem productivity, the importance of functionally distinct species (i.e. species that display an original combination of traits) is poorly understood. To investigate how distinct species affect ecosystem productivity, we used a forest-gap model to simulate realistic temperate forest successions along an environmental gradient and measured ecosystem productivity at the end of the successional trajectories. We performed 10 560 simulations with different sets and numbers of species, bearing either distinct or indistinct functional traits, and compared them to random assemblages, to mimic the consequences of a regional loss of species. Long-term ecosystem productivity dropped when distinct species were lost first from the regional pool of species, under the harshest environmental conditions. On the contrary, productivity was more dependent on ordinary species in milder environments. Our findings show that species functional distinctiveness, integrating multiple trait dimensions, can capture species-specific effects on ecosystem productivity. In a context of an environmentally changing world, they highlight the need to investigate the role of distinct species in sustaining ecosystem processes, particularly in extreme environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Recent work has shown that evaluating functional trait distinctiveness, the average trait distance of a species to other species in a community offers promising insights into biodiversity dynamics and ecosystem functioning. However, the ecological mechanisms underlying the emergence and persistence of functionally distinct species are poorly understood. Here, we address the issue by considering a heterogeneous fitness landscape whereby functional dimensions encompass peaks representing trait combinations yielding positive population growth rates in a community. We identify four ecological cases contributing to the emergence and persistence of functionally distinct species. First, environmental heterogeneity or alternative phenotypic designs can drive positive population growth of functionally distinct species. Second, sink populations with negative population growth can deviate from local fitness peaks and be functionally distinct. Third, species found at the margin of the fitness landscape can persist but be functionally distinct. Fourth, biotic interactions (positive or negative) can dynamically alter the fitness landscape. We offer examples of these four cases and guidelines to distinguish between them. In addition to these deterministic processes, we explore how stochastic dispersal limitation can yield functional distinctiveness. Our framework offers a novel perspective on the relationship between fitness landscape heterogeneity and the functional composition of ecological assemblages.},
